# Project-Euler
Scripts which solve the problems set out by the Euler Project - in R 

My solutions are unlikely to be the most effecient, or most clever way of solving the problems, but the solutions will be correct. I mainly use data manipulation technqiues as is my back ground.

If you believe that the solutions to Project Euler problems should not be shared, as suggested by the project itself, then do not read any of the scripts
